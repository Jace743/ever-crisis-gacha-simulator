You left off...

You're working on `test_ten_draw.py`. You decided that you'd just write the tests
and figure out all of the exact integration processes later. For now, you're making
a class that inherits from TenDraw (`TestTenDraw`), and you're writing four methods
that will test 2 (guaranteed 4* or not) x 2 (one or two featured weapons).

Other Info / Questions:
  -- You'll need to adapt CrystalPullSession.generate_target_probabilities() to create
     the target probabilities for your test. How can this be done in such a way that,
     if the original function is edited, you don't need to go change the test function?
  -- How can you incorporate fixtures? (might be relevant for previous question)
